					<h2>What is mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz?</h2>
					<h3>About Mumble</h3>
					<p><a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> is a freedom software, low latency, high quality voice chat application.</p>
					<h3>About mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz</h3>
					<p><a href="mumble://mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz">mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz</a> is the mumble server that I (wolfdaemon) host.</p>
					<h3>Why not just use a proprietary voice chat app like Dicksword?</h3>
					<p>Mumble just works and is easier/more ethical to use from an end-user standpoint. Everyone has more control on what data gets collected and send around, a lot of that has to do with the fact that Mumble is freedom software and a lot of the time -- there is zero need to collect "usage statistics" on a voice chat application. Discord continually has to come up with more ways to be "profitable" to justify continuing to operate as it currently does because from the ground up, Discord is designed to be anti-user/exploitative.</p>
					<p>In short, Discord is a proprietary, bloated, user-unfriendly app that collects data on and tracks users. What we already know about Discord's TOS, moderation, and technical practices are horrific enough -- what we don't know what the program does (especially since application's source code is a secret/black box, which means we can't know exactly what the program is doing on your PC) is much worse.

					Here's a short list that looks flashy for people with shorter attention spans:
						<ol>
							<li>Discord explicitly confirms in it's <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> that it collects and retains the following information from you:
								<ul>
									<li>IP Addresses</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord can track your general location</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Device UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier)</li>
									<li>Logs about what programs are open on your computer (using a process logger)</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord can tell what devices you use, how much you use each device, device usage habits.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>Email address</li>
									<li>All messages sent on the platform, including images, DMs, voice messages, audio files, etc.</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord logs every interaction you have with other users through its service: every conversation you have, everything you say, all images that you have sent. Nothing is private.</li>
										</ul>
									<li>All VOIP (voice chat/recording) data</li>
									<li>Other stuff that we don't know about... because the source code is a closed secret</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord's privacy policy also contains several occurrences of phrases such as "including but not limited to," which is an explicit confirmation that Discord contains more spyware features that are not disclosed to the user.</li>
										</ul>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>
