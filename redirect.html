					<h2>What is mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz?</h2>
					<h3>About Mumble</h3>
					<p><a href="https://www.mumble.info/">Mumble</a> is a freedom software, low latency, high quality voice chat application.</p>
					<h3>About mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz</h3>
					<p><a href="mumble://mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz">mumble.wolfdaemon.xyz</a> is the mumble server that I (wolfdaemon) host.</p>
					<h3>Why not just use a proprietary voice chat app like Dicksword?</h3>
					<p>Mumble just works and is easier/more ethical to use from an end-user standpoint. Everyone has more control on what data gets collected and send around, a lot of that has to do with the fact that Mumble is freedom software and a lot of the time -- there is zero need to collect "usage statistics" on a voice chat application. Discord continually has to come up with more ways to be "profitable" to justify continuing to operate as it currently does because from the ground up, Discord is designed to be anti-user/exploitative.</p>
					<p>In short, Discord is a proprietary, bloated, user-unfriendly app that collects data on and tracks users. What we already know about Discord's TOS, moderation, and technical practices are horrific enough -- what we don't know what the program does (especially since application's source code is a secret/black box, which means we can't know exactly what the program is doing on your PC) is much worse.

					Here's a cute list that looks flashy for people with shorter attention spans:
					
						<ol>
							<li><h4>Discord's source code is secret</h4>
								It's impossible to download, examine, and verify what Discord as an application is doing because source code is properietary i.e. secret-source. <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code"><em>Source code</em></a>, by the way, is the human-readable set of instructions written by programmers using a programming language to command a computer to do things. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html">Discord being proprietary software means that it is impossible to prove that Discord is not spyware: because we don't know what the code actually does. Any program which does not make its source code available is potential spyware.</a> 
							</li>
							<li><h4>Discord explicitly confirms in its <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">privacy policy</a> that it collects and retains the following information from you:</li>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>IP Addresses</strong></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord can track your general location.</li>
										</ul>
									<li><strong>Device UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier)</strong></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord can tell what devices you use, how much you use each device, device usage habits.</li>
										</ul>
									<li><strong>Usage statistics surrounding ever other program on your PC</strong></li>
										<ul>Discord uses a process logger to keep logs about what programs are open on your computer using a process logger</ul>
									<li><strong>Email address</strong></li>
									<li><strong>All messages sent on the platform, including images, DMs, voice messages, audio files, etc.</strong></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord logs every interaction you have with other users through its service: every conversation you have, everything you say, all images that you have sent. Nothing is private.</li>
										</ul>
									<li><strong>All VOIP (voice chat/recording) data</strong></li>
									<li><strong>Open rates for e-mail sent by Discord</strong></li>
									<li><strong>Other stuff that we don't know about... because the source code is a closed secret</strong></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Discord's privacy policy also contains several occurrences of phrases such as "including but not limited to," which is an explicit confirmation that Discord contains more spyware features that are not disclosed to the user.</li>
										</ul>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><h4>Discord Tries To Force Users To Give Phone Numbers</h4>
								Users are, after a time, eventually <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6181726888215-How-to-Verify-Your-Discord-Account">forced to provide their telephone numbers as a prerequisite for continued access or new registration</a>. The criteria for triggering this demand isn't given (nor clearly defined or consistent), with some users experiencing it randomly, while others consistently encounter it when connecting through a VPN or Tor. This practice raises significant privacy concerns, as phone numbers are highly personal information that can be linked to various other personal details and potentially enable the identification and localization of users, posing security vulnerabilities like identity theft.
								<ul>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><h4>Discord Readily Gives Government Agencies Information On Their Own Citizens</h4>
								<a href=https://archive.is/pqMmN">Discord readily cooperates and complies with law enforcement and government officials to collect conversational information on their private citizens via a streamlined, institutionalized, and easy process</a> they created with what Discord calls the <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260105220438/https://app.kodexglobal.com/discord/signin">Government Request Portal</a></em>, a summary of what information shared includes:
								<ul>
									<li><strong>User accout information</strong></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Email address</li>
										<li>Phone number</li>
										<li>IP address</li>
										<li>Other account details not specified.</li>
									</ul>
									<li><strong>Message content</strong></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Includes private messages</li>
									</ul>
									<li><strong>Voice/video call logs</strong></li>
									<ul>
										<li>May provide logs of voice and video calls. Even though Discord claims that calls on the website are end-to-end encrypted, <a href="https://docs.discord.com/developers/resources/message#message-call-object">Discord's Developer Documentation reveals that Discord records metadata on calls, particularly: what &amp; when calls were made, and who participated in said call</a> to build circumstantial evidence against users regarding the content/context of said calls.
									</ul>
